            <h2>ABOUT</h2>
            <p>
                Albert Einstein 14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist[5] who developed
                the theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics (alongside quantum
                mechanics).[3][6]:274 His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science.
                [7][8] He is best known to the general public for his mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc2,
                which has been dubbed "the world's most famous equation".[9] He received the 1921 Nobel Prize
                in Physics "for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the
                law of the photoelectric effect",[10] a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory.

                Near the beginning of his career, Einstein thought that Newtonian mechanics was no longer enough
                to reconcile the laws of classical mechanics with the laws of the electromagnetic field. This led
                him to develop his special theory of relativity during his time at the Swiss Patent Office in
                Bern (1902–1909), Switzerland. However, he realized that the principle of relativity could also
                be extended to gravitational fields, and he published a paper on general relativity in 1916 with
                his theory of gravitation. He continued to deal with problems of statistical mechanics and quantum
                theory, which led to his explanations of particle theory and the motion of molecules. He also
                investigated the thermal properties of light which laid the foundation of the photon theory of light.
                In 1917, he applied the general theory of relativity to model the structure of the universe.[11][12]
